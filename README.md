## Compatibility

This module requires [terraform] version >1.0 Additionally the [module_variable_optional_attrs] experiment is used.

## Usage

```hcl
module "tf-state-bucket" {
  source         = "metro-digital/cf-bucket/google"
  project_id     = "metro-cf-example-ex1-e8v"
  name           = "tf-state-metro-cf-example-ex1-e8v"
  location       = "EU"
  storage_class  = "MULTI_REGIONAL"
  uniform_access = true
  versioning     = true

  lifecycle_rules = [
    {
      action = {
        type          = "Delete"
      },
      condition = {
        num_newer_versions = 30
      }
    }
  ]

}
```
