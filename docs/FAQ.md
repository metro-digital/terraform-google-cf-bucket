## Security Scanning
### I want a bucket with uniform access disabled
The module supports disabling uniform access for bucket via `uniform_access` parameter. We strongly recommend to keep uniformed access enabled.
If you disable uniform access an additional label is placed on your bucket to prevent any security finding.
